# React Stocks

Single Page Application (SPA) built using React to search for and view stock prices using the Markit On Demand API.

## Demo

You can view the app in action at http://react-stocks.herokuapp.com. <br/>
*Please note that since the MoD API is not SSL secured the site must be viewed in HTTP and not HTTPS for the API calls to work.*
